Many popular "one-click" scripts nowadays have become ~~bloated~~ feature-rich, ~~lost their original purpose~~ very advanced.

So I decided to package my own DIY experience into a **truly** one-click script and share it.

This modified script is even more aggressive than standard one-clicks—so what should I call it? Zero-click? Well, you do still have to press Enter… but if scripts that require 101 keystrokes still call themselves "one-click," I’ll shamelessly call mine "**NoKey**."

No domain required. Perfect for both seasoned users who love tinkering and total beginners who want a hassle-free setup.

Run a single command, sit back, and wait. No chatter, no fuss—super fast. Ready to race any other script 🚀 Speed is my specialty.

> In testing, even a modest 1vCPU/1GB RAM VPS completed setup in under 20 seconds. Ideal for busy users.
